__2014__    



_iOS Software Engineer Intern_ - Capvision Partners, Shanghai, China

> Wrote an iOS app to help industry experts read and share news that matters in an app that keeps members up-to-date with events, projects, and project opportunities. Finished the summer by onboarding the next developer with a planned launch by the end of 2014

> For ten weeks, I collaborated with all-Chinese Marketing, Design, and IT team to lay out and develop the platform

> Implemented a networking client backed by Core Data and Restkit to persist JSON responses to a locally stored SQLite database, worked with networking guys to specify RESTful API for the client.

_Treasurer_ - oikos Penn

> I served as treasurer at oikos Penn for one academic year, taking on most event planning on marketing responsibilities to promote sustainable economics. During that time, I developed semester-long themes to improve event attendance (Sustainable Eats and Sustainably Sexy)

> I was blessed with the opportunity to attended the Presidentâ€™s Meet in St. Gallen, Switzerland with representatives spanning Europe and Asia and spent the week with one of the  groups of people that I've had the pleasure to know.

_Executive Board (Brother At Large), Recruitment Chair_ -  Pi Kappa Alpha

> During 2013 Rush, I planned and managed 9 events over 10 days with a $15,000 budget, coordinating 60-200-person events each day. The result was an increase in chapter size by 45%. I'm currently Brother At Large, which is basically a placeholder seat for someone that we want on the E-Board.

__2013__

_Product Development Intern_ - Resonate LLC, Berwyn, PA

> During my year at Resonate, I worked on both content and product design for the a sustainabilty software platform named Sustrana. What started as a summer internship became a part-time job through the school year.

> I spent the first half of the summer researching and writing educational content on various business topics. In the second half, I focussed on mockups and site design. My part-time work during the year consisted of designing an approach to risk management that could be implemented in on the Sustrana platform.

> Working at Resonate taught me the importance of working knowledge in diverse fields--content, design, tech, marketing--as well as just how fast things like to move, change, and flip around in the startup world.

__2012__

_Research Assistant_ - University of Pennsylvania

> I worked with Professor Horowitz on a summer research grant intended to teach first-year students about academic research. During that summer, I wrote profiles and collected data about various violent non-state actors (mostly terrorist organizations) for a couple upcoming books.

> Our work culminated in a year-long project (now supported by a team of RAs) on alliances between violent non-state actors funded by US Department of Defense.
