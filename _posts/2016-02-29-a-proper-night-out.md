The dinner party was a painful affair. The Lafayettes sat together across the table, content in their private and professional lives. In between bites of roasted lamb I complimented my sweet Maebelle on her cooking, as to signal to our guests the happy state of our marriage.

The Lafeyettes did not return the gesture. Mrs. Lafayette inquired about our pet cockatoo, Abbot. I informed her that Abbot had, I was afraid, died of asphyxiation after flying into the crawlspace just a few days prior. Our guests bowed their heads in acknowledgement.

As the main course drew to an end I felt weary of the petty conversation and grew increasingly aware of the Lafayette’s eating habits. Mrs. Lafayette scraped her knife and fork along the plate between sentences. Maebelle diagnosed the way in which I was pursing my lips as a sign of distress. My darling winked at me as she asked the Lafayettes about their work.

“Oh you know, making ends meet, trying to keep the apartment,” said Mrs. Lafayette.  

“That’s great,” said Maebelle.

“I do admire a woman who works for a living!” I said. “And how about you, Mr. Lafayette?”

“Jerry’s been clean for three months,” Mrs. Lafayette answered for her husband.

“Oh that is just wonderful to hear. My poor Maebelle has been homebound all year due to an unfortunate workplace incident.”

“I’ve been there, believe me. Back before me and Jerry got on our feet, let me tell you—”

I continued, “It’s not that I mind winning the bread, as it goes, but she feels so helpless. She has hardly left the house in months.”

Maebelle rose from the table.

“Sweet Maebelle. Here we are, modern citizens of the world and I’m practically a patriarch!” The Lafayettes laughed politely.

 “Jesus, I can’t do this,” Maebelle addressed our Lord.

“Dear, please don’t shout. You’ll upset our guests.”

“You’re unbelievable,” Maebelle seemed unable to articulate whatever was on her mind.

I was shocked and embarrassed at my own wife’s lack of support among good company. I informed our guests that it was time for them to leave. I asked Maebelle where we kept the plasticware containers but she did not respond. I packed the leftovers using dinner plates and paper towels and handed the parcels to the Lafayettes. They muttered praise for our decor as they left.

Maebelle had as yet failed to compose herself, so I thought it best that I respect her personal space. I kissed her on the cheek and followed the Lafayettes out the door.

The Lafayettes had crossed the street and I increased my pace to catch up with them. From the opposite sidewalk, they turned toward me without smiling. I opened my mouth to apologize for the dinner dramatics, but I was interrupted by the horn and headlights of a compact sedan.

“Watch out buddy,” said the driver.

“My apologies! I was just calling out to my friends and did not realize that I was in your way.” I was dismayed to find that the Lafayettes had left me. I placed my hand on the foreign-made hood of the car in a gesture of friendly conversation.

“You gonna move or what?” the driver continued.

“If I may appeal to your good will. I am feeling lonely and would like to go to town.”

The man did not respond. After a pause he unlocked his doors. I was so moved by his act of trust that I deferred to the back seat.  The upholstery inside the vehicle was a flat beige that appeared to be made of cow leather, although I doubted its authenticity.

“I do love the layout of your interior,” I said as I buckled my seatbelt.

The driver shivered in acknowledgement and shifted into gear.

“Alright man,” he paused. “So what’s your deal?”

“I am a friend, nothing more. Harold Lanois, pleased to be at your service.”

“Uh okay. I’m Frank.”

“Frank, a fine name. Of Germanic origin. It is a pleasure to meet you.” I looked at his reflection in the rearview mirror and drummed my fingers together. “And what is your profession, Frank?”

“Forklifts.”

“The horse cart of industry! Excellent, just excellent. And could you tell me about a typical day on the job?”

“Well, I get in a forklift, and I find some stuff. I move things from where they are to where they go. The pay’s fine, I’m not complaining.”

“And what are some of your favorite experiences as a forklift driver?”

“I dunno, it’s fun I guess.”

“Can you point me toward a specific experience?”

“Look I don’t know what you’re trying to do here, but it’s weird man.” Frank turned on the radio.

I pursed my lips and listened to the advertisements. A woman’s voice explained how a home loan would bring me competitive interest rates and accounts with no transaction fees.

I broke the silence as we approached the town.

“Thank you for driving me Frank. I applaud your fine motor skills and appreciate how you’ve applied your professional driving experience to the open road.”

Frank asked me to leave as we reached the main intersection. I waved to him as he accelerated away.

Unsure of how to spend the rest of my evening, I entered a fast food establishment in hopes of interviewing one of its employees.

Inside, I witnessed a tall man with dark curly hair dancing with ferocious energy as he waited for his turn to order. He wore a backpack lined with reflective metal keychains and a dark hooded sweatshirt. His pockets appeared to be weighed down with coins. With each vigorous thrust of the beat, his entire body rang with the sound of metal.

I stood beside a garbage bin to appreciate the scene. The dancing man slammed a handful of nickels onto the counter and retrieved his beverage.

A chubby boy carried a tray of food. With an unexpected spin, the dancing man knocked the boy’s uneaten hamburger and french fries onto the floor. The man smiled at the boy and performed a shuffle around the fallen meal.

I pursed my lips as I contemplated how to aid the situation. The dancing man squatted to pick up individual french fries with one hand and collected them in the other. He moved to a silent beat. He slid the child’s still-wrapped hamburger across the floor to rest at my feet.  I handed it to the boy, who ran from whence he came. I nodded politely and averted my eyes.

“I suppose I must be going,” I muttered at last.

The man did not respond, but moved his hips in place, keeping his eyes on mine.

“Is there something I can do for you?” I asked.

He rolled his arms and shoulders and his keychains rang to a syncopated beat. I blinked and walked toward the exit. We walked in the same direction for several paces before I worked up the courage to engage him in conversation.

“I find your accessories fascinating,” I told him.

He failed to acknowledge my compliment, but slowed his stride to meet mine.

“Where exactly are we going?” I asked.

He did not answer and continued his rhythmic clinking as I admired his accessories. One section of his bag held keychains from different locations across the United States. There was a space needle from Seattle, an arch from St. Louis, a Kokopelli from Santa Fe, and a chrome-plated cheese wedge from Madison. Mounted on the back pocket were religious symbols, adjacent to a section for domesticated animals. A silver Hamsa petted a housecat as the dancing man bounced down the street.

We reached the entrance of a dance hall full of young people. I spotted a group of young women whom I assumed my companion would be interested in courting.

“Look at those sprite young chickens,” I said winking.

He motioned for me to enter the hall. Once inside, the dancing man moved toward the dance floor. His keychains shook and glimmered with the beat of the music. The noise was difficult for me to bear. I padded my ears with my hands and pursed my lips with added vigor. It seemed that I was the only one in the establishment with such aural sensitivity. Just as I felt that it was time for me to leave, the dancing man approached me.

He motioned for my hand. He placed two foam earplugs in my palm and returned to the dance floor.

The dancing man span and shimmered in the darkness of the room. At first he danced alone. At times he was joined by women, who were then joined by other men who hoped to dance with them.

Once he was joined by a woman wearing shoes embedded with fake crystals. Yet rather than inquire about the poor quality of her apparel, the dancing man simply syncopated his step with hers and flailed her about without smiling.

As the crowd grew, I could not help but fear that I would somehow lose my companion to the masses. But each time the crowd grew thick so as to obscure my view of him, the dancing man would reappear and continue his wild movements on an open space of the floor.

After several cycles of this behavior, the dancing man approached me and motioned toward the exit. I tried to mimic his fluid movements as we left the dance hall together.

Outside, I removed the earplugs from my ears. I rolled them between my fingers in attempt to remove the excess wax that had accumulated.

“Would you like your earplugs back?” I said.

“Keep them,” said the dancing man. He bowed and walked away.

The sound of clinking metal faded with the man. I put the earplugs in my pocket and returned home to tell my wife.
