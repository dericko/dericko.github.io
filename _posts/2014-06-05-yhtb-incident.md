__There was an early morning incident.__

Listen:

There are murmerings, a disturbance in the neighborhood. The curtains are drawn. It is not yet six; but still, I hear them.

Come young, come old, each and every one shall gather to witness the spectacle. A thick summer air joined by sweating bodies in the formless mass below. And the voices come together in a wave, growing, growing, each crest accented with a male shout.

Perhaps he is their leader. An opposition party: a rally against increasing vegetable prices. I hope it's nothing to do with the Lanzhou family. They are the friendliest shop owners on the block. Yet I've met people who won't eat there because they think its associated with Xinzhuang radicals; right... Anti-religious rallies aside, the shouts are getting louder.

I was still in bed. I eased over to the window and saw a crowd, as massive as I had imagined, just outside my building. I pressed play, trying my best to keep the phone camera pointed straight without missing the real scene in front of me.

An old man stood defiantly, as young man yelled. There was a response. The young man pushed the old man, forcing him to a seat on the bench behind him. Nobody objected to this.

People gathered in close, a few took turns shouting at the man. For a moment, nobody seemed to know what to do. 

And then the police showed up. An officer addressed the old man, but neither responded further. The man sat back, and smoked a cigarrette. The other officers attempted to disperse the crowd as it pressed inwards. And the seemed to be at a loss.

The officer grabbed the man by the shoulders. He continued with his cigarrete. A second officer grabbed the man and pushed him hard. The three flew forward, catching their balance against the crowd. The officers led the men offscreen. Shit, I was watching on my phone.
