title: Judgment and Penitence
description: "So we went to Eastern State Penitentiary for the haunted house. It was actually pretty good--almost like a theme park ride. On my second visit (in the daytime), I took the chance to be more cynical."

From its central command hub, seven corridors of cells radiate as spokes in full view of any guard on watch. The skylight openings cut out of the ceilings light the arching corridors as cathedrals, housing inmates on either side in wait of penance. Decades of service have worn away the interior so that around the perimeter of each cell, piles of chipped paint and plaster serve as lead-ridden floorboards. All light comes from narrow slits, angled perfectly as to allow a full room's light through a mere three-inch slot. The architecture is both aesthetically and functionally pleasing, a marriage of utility and grandeur altogether unexpected in a prison.

Not all doors are open. Beside a blocked-off corridor there is an iron gate, blocking a black curtain. A small hole in the curtain reveals a peculiar row of mannequins, dressed in prisoner garb. I had stumbled upon the backstage of Eastern State Penitentiary's unfortunate yearly production, "Terror Behind the Walls". Each autumn, this site is stripped of its significance and made up to be a seasonal attraction. I am convinced that the effects of this production run counter to the interests of those involved.

The yearly production is successful, even nationally acclaimed; I do not dispute this in the least. It is carried out professionally, and is highly attended throughout its season. Yet such manufactured entertainment cheapens the site into an entertainment venue. I believe that this complete lack of respect can be nothing but bad taste. It feeds a mentality of high-thrill entertainment that can be purchased and enjoyed without effort, without thought. I do not say this to be a miser of all things enjoyable, as this sort of entertainment has its place: but it should not be this place. The Penitentiary is a site of intricate contrasts: colonial rationalism and religious fanaticism, spiritual reform and psychological torment, modern functionality and traditional beauty. The ambivalence of this site is a remarkable source of thought and reflection, a source which is at risk of being utterly engulfed by the loudness of terror attractions which do not present any depth to their content, but rather thrust entertainment down the throats of all observers. It would be of no great benefit to completely eliminate this form of entertainment, as we should each be granted access to that which we enjoy, but I do believe that there are few tragedies greater than the loss of warranted experience at the expense of cheap thrills.

I was fortunate enough to stumble upon the real Eastern State: to see the various perspectives of the prison's enlightenment design, Quaker spirituality, and utterly soul-crushing solitude, to experience the uncertain feelings and lack of closure that accompanies the difficult topic of how to marshal those fellow beings who are unfit for society. Yet the headlines provide a single description for the grounds: "Darker…bloodier…terror…like you've never felt."
