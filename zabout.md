Here's what I've been up to lately:

__2014__    

_Teaching Assistant_ - CIS120: Programming Languages and Techniques I

> This fall, I'll be leading weekly recitations of 10-20 students. I hope to learn new ways of approaching problems by guiding others and by working with a brilliant team of TAs. It's gonna be a blast!

_iOS Software Engineer Intern_ - Capvision Partners, Shanghai, China

> I'm currently writing an iOS app to help industry experts read and share  news that matters in an multi-functional app that keeps members up-to-date with new events, projects, and opportunities. I'm currently finishing up the networking, and onboarding the next developer who will bring the app to launch later in 2014

> Over the past two months, I've collaborated with all-Chinese Marketing, Design, and IT team to lay out and develop this app

> I've designed and implemented a networking client backed by Core Data and Restkit to persist JSON responses to a locally stored SQLite database, and am currently working with the PHP guys to specify a RESTful API for the client.

> In the process, I've made some awesome friends, learned the best songs for Chinese karaoke, and really upped my badminton game

_Treasurer_ - oikos Penn

> I served as treasurer at oikos Penn for one academic year, taking on most event planning on marketing responsibilities to promote sustainable economics. During that time, I developed semester-long themes to improve event attendance (Sustainable Eats and Sustainably Sexy)

> I was blessed with the opportunity to attended the Presidentâ€™s Meet in St. Gallen, Switzerland with representatives spanning Europe and Asia and spent the week with one of the  groups of people that I've had the pleasure to know.

_Executive Board (Brother At Large), Recruitment Chair_ -  Pi Kappa Alpha

> During 2013 Rush, I planned and managed 9 events over 10 days with a $15,000 budget, coordinating 60-200-person events each day. The result was an increase in chapter size by 45%. I'm currently Brother At Large, which is basically a placeholder seat for someone that we want on the E-Board.

_Product Development Intern_ - Resonate LLC, Berwyn, PA

> During my year at Resonate, I worked on both content and product design for the a sustainabilty software platform named Sustrana. What started as a summer internship became a part-time job through the school year.

> I spent the first half of the summer researching and writing educational content on various business topics. In the second half, I focussed on mockups and site design. My part-time work during the year consisted of designing an approach to risk management that could be implemented in on the Sustrana platform.

> Working at Resonate taught me the importance of working knowledge in diverse fields--content, design, tech, marketing--as well as just how fast things like to move, change, and flip around in the startup world.

__2012__

_Research Assistant_ - University of Pennsylvania

> I worked with Professor Horowitz on a summer research grant intended to teach first-year students about academic research. During that summer, I wrote profiles and collected data about various violent non-state actors (mostly terrorist organizations) for a couple upcoming books.

> Our work culminated in a year-long project (now supported by a team of RAs) on alliances between violent non-state actors funded by US Department of Defense.
