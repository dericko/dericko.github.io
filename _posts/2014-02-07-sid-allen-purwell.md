A quick breath entered the nostrils of Sid Allen Purwell, the associate manager at Allied Partners, as he woke this morning, a full thirty minutes before his scheduled alarm. Mr. Purwell lay without stirring, grasping for what had just passed. With each slow blink, he fell back into some reality, unseeing and unsure of his present state. With the next blink, his senses sharpened. Mr. Purwell squinted at the uneventful scene around him. The white walls undecorated but for a well-annotated calendar, the reading light left on from the night before, the hardwood desk sprinkled with cigarette ash, the set of dress clothes hung with care on the back of a folding chair. It was as if each item wished to personally reassure Mr. Purwell of his wakefulness, that he was here in his own third-floor studio in Santana Row, that he had made something of himself, that he was just getting started. Mr. Purwell caught a sigh in mid heave and threw a hand to his face. In an instant he rose from bed and stumbled into the washroom. Supporting himself on either side of the sink, Mr. Purwell looked up to the mirror. An altogether unimpressive figure stared back at him. He examined each angle of his face, ensuring that each smile, frown, and grimace was fully operational. What a pity it would have been to find a single blemish on a day as important as this.
