__Unpleasantness? It's not a place, man, it's a state of mind.__

You know, that falling feeling of helpless wakeful blankness. Staring at the unpostered wall, contemplating the higher meaning of plasterflecks scuffmarks pinholes paint. There's no way out of here. White walls make a room look larger, but it's just an expanded seething flow of empty space. A shuffle to the left to the left to the right and back into an empty seat in empty room in empty house.

Now, the weather outside is delightful. From above, I hear the throbbing bass of car trunk beats on oversized rims. Extra decibels and diameters overcompensating for what? And the light changes and you move on and others come and they move on and I can criticize your phallic ineptitudes all I want but that does not change the fact that today I am completely and utterly incapable of doing. Oh Motivation you sexy rascal you bitch what happened? You're flaccid.

__A walk. An activity. Let's get the juices flowing and up that productivity.__

Sometimes it is better to just start with something simple. A tangible task, a concrete action, something you can taste, get a little oomph out of. Some can-do attitude, that real functional-practical: the common room could use a little tidying. Polyester cushions much more than askew, have made a run for it, scattered on the floor. I capture them once more placing each in alternating order and order is restored, a perfect order of browns tans beiges against a white white wall, echoing the perfection of the household devoid of uncertainty. And the walls extend to infinity and I can't help but notice the imperfect specks of dust on the sill and that someone stacked the bowls upon the little plates instead of the little plates upon the big plates with the bowls to the right, thus allowing the cups to stretch in their corner of the cupboard and every place has its object and every object has its place and its not quite right and I can't not notice. So I notice. A bit of careful reflection never hurt anyone, right? Each spice has a spot so I organize in layers: from left to right from sweet to salty to spicy, from back to front from large to medium to small. But curséd Siracha! your green tip extends too high, what am I to do to you Mr. Back-Right-Corner? You have no place here, you just don't fit, in fact you're worse—you've ruined the perfection of my perfect system. What I am I to do with you? What am I to do?
Looking up, still no one is home; still walls are so white, still house is so still.

__Slack-jawed at the painful reality of time travel:__ that simultaneity of hopeless boredom and mindless activity, condensed within the spotless walls of the household, has propelled me through time from morning to night in a most alarming fashion. And the result? That pit in the stomach grows heavier, and gives a little flitter of panic whenever it realizes that it has done nothing to absolve its situation. There is a voice, terrifying, that whispers of the possibility of today-as-life, that the hopeless slump is not a slump, but the beginning of a one-way descent into a state of being, always incapable of Doing, of forced functionality overcoming meaningful activity, of staying indoors all day doing nothing every day every day every week every month, every day.
