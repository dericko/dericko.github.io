title: On Studying
description: "It is the day-to-day marker of maturity and responsibility, (Sorry, I have work to do). It is a way to keep up with friends, (Where shall we study tonight?) It is a cheap method of picking up dates (I know this great spot...). It has entered the social sphere: studying is, as are alcohol and eating out, a staple among interpersonal lubricants."

> The secret to success is habituation, the integration of study into the day-to-day interactions between each of us. Effective studying is altogether ordinary.

_I once at the library observed a young man who opposed the routine; he failed magnificently._

He sits alone: contemplates, hesitates, starts over again. White-hot lines brand his eyelids, the kind that come from camera flashes in dark rooms. Each slow blink is overlaid by the boldfaced words: __must not sleep__ 

This is workload paralysis of the highest degree (the utterly painful condition that accompanies parallel deadlines in which one is unable to begin an assignment without being bombarded with the thoughts of other important assignments, leaving the victim in a constant state of starting, reassessing priorities, restarting, reassessing, etcetera). At 2100hrs, he has a thought, a novel decisionâ€”He declares personal agency with a minor revision: _will_ not sleep. His jaw unclenches, his foot stops tapping, his lungs fill to capacity for the first time in hours. Time has become infinite. He spends a full hour blocking out his night, packing the essentials for each class, and bringing the perfect snacks to maintain the perfect ratio of blood sugar to caffeination.

In the Undergraduate Lounge they sat, emotionless, working in earnest as they often do. He entered with swaggering shoulders, a swing and a smile in each step. He slid up to a desk and made it his own: unpacked his items, one at a time, and arranged them by size, color, and priority.

__Altogether he has twelve hours before class.__ There is time enough for everything. As he sets off on work, he chuckles at their frantic attempts to finish, to return home.

Their stamina was at its end, so they left. As they passed they observed a great transformation: his brows were furrowed, eyes narrowed, and lips tight, determined. He did not notice them, so they left him, sure that he would do what he needed to do.

The room is silent. He does not remember the last time he looked up from the screen, so he looks up. The crowds have dispersed; the desks are empty. There is nothing to hear because there is no one left to hear. He pushes off the table and places his things at a new desk, extending his reign across the chamber: at 5am, he is its master. Feeling the weight of the night, he drains a cup of stale coffee, and continues on his way.

__Twelve lines of text, a paragraph. He starts, and something happens.__ He looks up, and finds his place. He starts, and something happens. The whole of his consciousness is focused on this phrase. He rereads to get his bearings, continues. Something happens. All he remembers is this phrase. He starts, and something happens. Wide eyes and a sharp breathe in, he cranks his neck to face the ceiling, shaking head and arms and hands awake. There is no way to keep on.

Defeated, he returns home for a ninety-minute nap. In the morning, he will be able to think. Light on, he falls over the covers, fully clothed.

I awoke this afternoon with three missed calls. I must have slept through class.
