-Advice from upper management, which somehow worked quite well.

There isn't much to do here, I'm essentially researching news and writing English articles that will then be translated into Chinese. Not exactly an efficient process. Furthermore, translating memos into Enlgish is not an especially enriching experience. My supervisor, let's call her Debbie, came up with a longer-term  product development project, but I could tell that it would consist mostly of internet research and powerpoints. I wanted to create something.

I described my situation to one of the heads of the company. He told me, "Just go in there and be like, 'Hey. I'm...I'm a dude.'" Eloquently put.  

So I met with Debbie, and some other managers. I placed my skillset on the table, fully disclosing my experiences or lack thereof, and emphasized my ability to learn.

It turns out, they've been wanting a native mobile app for a while, but it isn't easy to find competent iOS engineers in Shanghai. So here I am, totally responsible for the planning, design, and implementation of a proprietary project manager meets news reader meets professional network.

I still can't believe how easy it was to ask for this project. I've already discovered the dangers of being too helpful (read: everyone in the office gives you bitchwork). But I think I've discovered how to use this to my advantage. Everyone seems happy to give me work, but this time I'm setting the rules, content, and timeline of a specific project. A little structure seems to go a long way.

Well, here it goes.
