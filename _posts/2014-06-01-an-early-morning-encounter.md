title: "Concerning an Early Morning Encounter, Or, The Marriage of Bosse-de-Nage"
description: "Anyone familiar with Alfred Jarry must know about his dog-faced baboon Bosse-de-Nage, and will hopefully appreciate my attempt at marrying off this odd character. Anyone unfamiliar with Alfred Jarry may not know what to think of it. But it was too tempting not to give Jarry's eccentric writing style a try, so here it is."

Plunged in dagian half-light, we awoke upon desks on elbowed pillows: seat-backs upright, ankles shackled to the floor.

A rhythmic swaying affronted the vestibule of my bony labyrinth. That is to say I was on a boat. That is to say I was on a ship, a big ship, a spectacular vessel at sea. My desk pencil rolling, unsure. I doubled back in mid-sentence: rolling, unsure. I had stumbled upon this craft in Paris three months past, mistaking an ad for a _classe de piratage_ for that of free online music. For three months I toiled, learning the finer points of sail, sabre, and sea.

We sat with eyes ready, knees knocking, anticipating the curtain drop that would reveal our benevolent pedagogue.

As it fell, she stood upon her head, _sirsasana_ atop the table, feet looming high above us: frowning as to smile to upright audiences. Her wiry frame was draped in pirate drab: boots of swashbuckling, unbuckled; leggings of a younger Pan; a coat of tanned animal hide. Her hair was also upside down, as is fitting for one in her position. At starboard ear lay J'aimerde, the unmarried Portuguese water dog, who refused to speak a word beyond an energetic "Aha!" which she uttered with a perfectly consistent enthusiasm.

Our leader aroused our minds with an Eastern proverb:

"Man who propose to dog often kneel in shit."

"Aha!" observed J'aimerde, defecating neatly.

A crash and crack of holy skylight announced the first sunrise of that morning. Ho! Abreast our noble craft a worthy sieve skirted upon a sea. With the click of swashbuckled boots, we were released from our chains. I alighted from that which holds to observe o'er the edge:

Six anterior members upon their resting place supported tripartite torsos. Three marine figures so engulfed in oceanic duties as to miss our approach. The first held oars with hands and chin with chest: harnessed by foot, thus incapable of upward glances. The next figure: a dog-faced baboon, genus Papio, with a protrusion of buttocks painted red and blue on each cheek, each defying gravity and decency nonetheless gaily. He jumped about wildly (an unwarranted effort hardly befitting the dignity of his position). In a moment of clarity, he exclaimed "Haha," but refrained from further comment as he directed his hips in a salacious thrust toward the posterior end of the third and final passenger:

A man of medium height, overseeing the skiff's guide ropes. An array of navigatory tools at his fingertips accented a large can of corned beef hung by way of neck. He was clearly a doctor; I knew not of what. And all the while he muttered at his companions, who paid him no attention. The doctor declined his simian companion's rectocopulatory advances with tact and good taste.

Our mistress reminded us of our training as we prepared to board the vessel. We prayed first to our gods, and then to our guns, and fired at the skiff. The dog-faced baboon avoided our shots and brandished his teeth, four of which were missing. I saw the mark of Kidd upon his forehead, with the words BOSSE-DE-NAGE, PAPIO CYNOCEPHALUS, and realized that we were not the first marauders with whom he had crossed paths.

At the same moment, the doctor was amongst us offering gin to our captain, who obliged him immediately. They spoke in hushed voices behind closed doors.

The baboon Bosse-de-Nage approached J'aimerde and began to speak, "ha ha." He was interrupted by an adamant "Aha!" and declined further comment. The two stood resolutely at the ship's bow, without need of words. Bosse-de-Nage examined J'aimerde, unsure of the sanctity of her past. He fell to one knee and kissed her paw. His knee rested in feces. Out of the glowing disk above, a dove descended upon the pair, and sanctified their marriage. Biped and quadruped, sat together on haunches, brows furrowed in contemplation of their action:

The marriage of minds is a curious thing, altogether more complex than the corporal union of PapioCanis. Does one simply concatenate the two in Darwinian order, that is to say: HAHA-AHA? Now, in this marriage sacrosanct, it follows that the resultant whole will utter a heptad "Hahaaha," which is in fact indistinguishable to all observers beyond our highly esteemed reader as the sextet "Hahaha." It clearly follows that in old world orthography, one subtracts the unwieldy h, leaving us with a tripartite AAA. This trinity, in fact, is the culminated whole resultant from this timely marriage of dog and dogface. In [works prior][exploits-opinions] it has been shown that A=A, especially when convenient. Observe that the principle of identity is thwarted, the equation unbalanced. The breakdown of AAA into A=AA and AA=A yield the same unsavory inequality. The equality of the double cannot be without the inequality of the triple. Thus the tripartite whole cannot be unbroken: it is the simultaneous existence of a single and triple dimension, the spiral lifted and pressed into paper, ascending and descending without bound. This tripled pair, the unnamed but not unmarried PapioCanis, utters AAA. And we cannot but recognize a Holy Trinity within this speech.

Lost in the pondering of such weighty things, Bosse-de-Nage sighed, "haha," -"aha!" finished J'aimerde without pause. And the pair sat on, looking back neither at us, nor our mighty captains, nor the unfortunate bailiff shackled to his skiff below. The pair sat on and stared on, onward at the ethernity before them.
