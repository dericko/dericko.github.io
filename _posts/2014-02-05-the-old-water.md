> "Get a group of words (make a list or select at random); then form these words (only) into a piece of writing..." [-Bernadette Mayer][bernadette-mayer]
 
the neighborhood office woke at trouble  
for one always told of unhappiness:  
smoke it up  
hours in one little place
tight forehead    
then breasts asked softly  
she wanted the brandy, the old water  
the sign that said its changed   
water landing adhesive down there   
changed at the trousers   
dinner was mine be(-fore)
little images turned dust, crackling

 (rearranged the last word per page of Part I of Camusâ€™ The Stranger, Vintage International 1989)
