__Here we observe three stages of ingestion.__

__Sustenance__: Percent daily value.   
The sorriest sort of eater, that who eats merely to sustain  bodily functions, is missing out on a significant joy of sentient life. It suggests the degeneration of the eater from human to something less than living, something stripped of even the basest of physical pleasures. Stripped of its joy, eating is a mechanical process, a meaningless means to an en

__Pleasure__: The joy of cooking.  
I eat because I'm happy. I'm happy because I eat. The soothing sizzle of bacon, the audiovisual snack. Hot oils graced with water-holding proteins snap crackle and pop delightfully. With each breath in, he flares his nostrils out, in hopes of a whiff to help him taste before tasting. Impulsive fingers jut forward-just a bite, a bite! The searing pain provides a perfect contrast. This pain, it is everything that eating is not. Together, these opposites delineate the outer limits of this hedonic existen.

__Experience__: Going out to eat  
(a concatenation greater than the sum of its parts).  
Going out to eat has little to do with hunger, pleasure, or tangible desires at all. Perhaps it is best understood through example:

> We rode unnecessarily far in order to wait unnecessarily long for an unnecessarily pricey (not to mention unnecessarily greasy) cheesesteak. It was an exceedingly positive time.

> There is a sense of urgency throughout. We leave behind cupboards and refrigerator shelves of cheap, tasty, and convenient food. We leave it all in order to find something else. Out the door and down the steps, in search of good weather, new food, and streets with bike lanes.

> As we enter, the menu shines above. An overabundance of steaks, cheesesteaks, pizzasteaks, burgers, fries, and a shrimp pizza roll. I order everything and finish finish every bite. A shout! a tap on the shoulder. Apparently I'm next in line. Still dazed from the pre-food coma, I walk up and order the first thing I see. Fifteen agonizing minutes. The ring of a bell is a public acknowledgment of our quest for something better. Two Italian rolls emerge, stuffed with sloppy ecstasy. Without another word, we dive into our heroic subs.
The penultimate bite: as whiz violates my left knee I can't fully wrap my head around why this experience is enjoyable. I was not even that hungry and have long since passed full; the fries and bread and meat and cheese-colored product have taken care of that. Beside me, he inhales his final bite. As our eyes meet, a ketchup-stained grin spreads across his face. It was his first time. Somehow, our meal had become an experience.

__Host__: A corollary.
Containing the elements of both otherness and home, combining the experience of host and guest, the dinner party is the epitome of human nourishment.
