> Upon hearing that I rode my bike to class each day he asked, _"But when do you find time to think?"_

The next morning I left early for class, on foot. I have heard that one never forgets how to ride a bike. Let us hope the same applies to walking. This is the time for reflection, for walking requires little knowledge. An internal mastery of this exercise allows me to step without thought, to let the mind drift into a creative state previously reserved for hot showers and bedtime restlessness.

On the way to campus, everyone's faces are blank slates looking forward, despite the cold haziness of the day. Each step retraces the path of a thousand others, repeated every day, totaling a grand migration beyond the limits of my comprehension. Together we walk on. Shuffling or strutting, brisk or lackadaisical, we take our journey upon the most primordial of human vehicles, our own two legs, in search of possibility.

I observe the young woman who is running late: a downturned chin, a furrowed brow, a brief whitening of the knuckles, supported by two legs pushing their limits, unwilling to break into a jog. This is the tension that accompanies purposed movement. She is a survivor of the migrations of old, one who cast aside worldly beauty and stationary pleasure in order keep on. Today, she will use her biological inheritance to outpace the others, and make up the lost time.

The building is in sight, but I have not finished walking. In hopes of avoiding the tragic fate of the woman running late, of the devolution from saunter into utilitarian movement, of falling into an archaically purposeful habit of getting from one predetermined place to another, I willfully ignore my judgment and walk past the entrance of the classroom, onwards past campus, crossing bridges, crossing streets, pushing forward upon the whim of each step.

In a grid so perfect as a city's there is no way to lose oneâ€™s way. It is a place that I can truly wander. Today there are applications to show the shortest route from location to destination, perfectly eliminating the need for either. On two feet I escaped the possibility of an external influence on this stroll. I step with the knowledge that I am in absolute control of my own path, and understand the value of leisure. An expert in bipedal motion, I dominate the landscape, the cityscape, taking a new route, encountering construction, and literally turning on a hairpin and retracing my steps back. What careless joy there is in city walking.
