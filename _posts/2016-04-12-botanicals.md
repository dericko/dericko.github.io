Rosemary Taft adjusted the basil as she followed her sales associate through the doorway of the single family home. She pulled behind her a cart of live herbs and vegetables. As she lifted the cart over the threshold, she wondered when the homeowners had last aerated their lawn.

“Come in, ladies. I’m Jimmy Canola.”

“Anise Platz, pleased to meet you. This is Rose. We’re here to check on the herb kit you ordered last month. Did everything arrive as expected?”

“Oh, sure. It’s by the window sill.”

“A smart man,” Anise examined the plants on the sill. “Jimmy, you look like a real cook.”

“I dabble.”

Anise picked a sprig of thyme and flicked it to the floor. “These starter herbs aren’t gonna cut it for you. What you need is quality. Rose? Would you mind showing this nice man some of the herbs he’s missing out on?”

Rose placed a selection of potted basils on the counter and proceeded to describe them. “Let’s see, we’ve got your traditional genovese, Thai basil, dwarf greek. Finissimo verde if you’re into that kind of thing. Careful with the genovese though, they’ll grow right up past the blinds if you don’t keep an eye on them!”

“Thanks Rose, why don’t you run to the van and grab us some toolkits?” Anise adjusted her breasts and turned back to Jimmy Canola. “Any questions?”

“Are they fertile?”

“They certainly are. It’s all a matter of pollination.”

“Sounds good to me.”

“Here’s a sage flower. Don’t be shy, give the stamen a good rub. Now brush that pollen on the stigmas. Be gentle now, they’re delicate. These tomato flowers just needs some vibration. An electric toothbrush would do the trick.”

Rose opened the door of the climate-controlled van. Its walls were lined hydroponic tubes and various indoor flora. The space was sectioned off with blackout curtains and a timed lighting system. At the rear was the potting station and collection of tools for sale. As she picked out a beginner’s gardening set, Rose imagined her daughter in a few years, replacing the water filters and programming the lights to mimic the seasons. Heck, she thought, she’s probably old enough already.

Rose returned to find Anise on the counter with a pollination brush in her mouth. She was teaching Jimmy how to clean it between uses. Rose dropped the leather satchel of handcrafted tools on the counter. “Careful not to cross-pollinate, those are heirlooms you’ve got there.”

Anise jumped off the counter and grabbed the toolkit. “You like to work with your hands, Jimmy? American-made, for an All-American man.”

“Oh, that’s nice. But I should really talk to my wife before I start buying a bunch of new stuff.”

Rose started packing up the cart. Anise continued, “Is there anything else I can do for you?”

“I think I’m good,” said Jimmy Canola.

The women finished packing in silence. Rose turned at the door, “You should water your lawn early in the morning. It prevents fungal growth.”

The pair entered the climate-controlled van: Rose at the wheel and Anise in the back to tend to the vegetable nursery.

“Dang, I really thought we had him,” said Anise.

Rose dropped Anise off before going home to her family. She grabbed the mail on her way to the door. Her husband Garam was making spaghetti using a recipe he found online. Rose kissed him hello and handed him a fresh sprig of basil. She flipped through the mail in search of commission checks before going back to check on Cumin.

“Mommy look!” Cumin ran up cupping a tadpole with little legs in her hands.

“Wow, she's almost grown up! Let's put her back with her friends.”

“Okay,” the girl shrugged. Rose opened the aquatic garden as her daughter tiptoed to drop the tadpole back in.

“How was school today?”

“Good. Ms. Brussels said it's Bring Your Child To Work Day next week.”

“That's great! You could ride with us in the veggie van. Remember Anise? She’d be so happy to see you.”

“I don’t think I can come with you.”

“Don’t be silly, of course you can. That’s one of the perks of having a mommy in business.”

“I told Daddy I wanna stay home with him.”

“Oh, okay. Do you have a permission slip?”

“Yeah it's in my backpack.”

Rose checked her daughter’s backpack for the permission slip. She took out a paper bag with a sandwich and uneaten apple.

“Why didn't you eat your sandwich?”

“Well Sherry had two lunchables because she kissed Tony as a dare and then she couldn't finish it so she gave it to me and I liked it better.”

“Daddy made it special for you.”

“I didn't wanna waste it. I brought it home so we could have it for dinner.”

“Well we’d better eat it quick before Daddy sees.”

Rose unwrapped the soggy sandwich and took a bite. She handed it to Cumin, who made a face.

“Food’s ready,” said Garam from the living room.

The three nodded for Grace at the kitchen counter. “How was your day?” asked Garam.

“Super. Half a dozen sales and some subscription renewals.”

“How’s Anise?”

"She's alright, why?"

"Just wondering."

“She’s seeing someone. It’s been good for her.”

“That’s good.”

After dinner, Rose went over the day’s orders and deliveries and updated her weekly progress chart. She hoped to hire another saleswoman by the end of the quarter so she could focus on growing her enterprise.

She returned to the living room to find Cumin and her husband playing with a train set on the floor. It wound its way around her collection of potted plants. The track pieces were uneven on the carpet and the train derailed as it passed the magnolias.

“Time for bed you two,” said Rose.

Garam and his daughter run to the bathroom to brush their teeth. Rose browsed her collection of botany books and selected a biography from the shelf. Garam and Cumin came out of the bathroom laughing about a joke. He hugged Cumin goodnight and handed her off to Rose. “I'll see you up there,” said Garam as he went to the bedroom.

Rosemary tucked Cumin into bed. Last summer they had painted the walls of the bedroom to look like vines, using real honeysuckles as accents. Rose sat next to the bed and opened her copy of Barbara McClintock: Nobel Prize Geneticist. She read aloud to her daughter and asleep in her chair.
