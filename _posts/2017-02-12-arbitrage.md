It was 4 o'clock so I put on the Arbitrage! live trading stream and hollered over to Denny to take a break from his homework. Denny curled up beside me on the couch and we repeated our Arbitrage! Affirmations. I reminded him to log in on his TeleClick so he could trade in real time.

"Sell two man hours -- Eritreans!" Denny shouted. And boy can I say how proud I was to be a dad at that moment, my own son making calls on Arbitrage! like his old man. The TeleClick responded sorry I don't understand what you said can you please repeat your answer? and I thought darn it (!!) I should have sprung for the Polylect expansion with kids voice edition! I helped Denny re-sus his thoughts and reminded him how to speak from his diaphragm. I sure wish they taught him these things at school. Back before the accident I used to walk Denny to class before my first job of the day. Denny's school is pretty bleak. Once I stopped by at lunch and saw a group of maybe-forth-graders corner a kid against the chain link fence that bordered the playground. They poked him till he cried. They made a big show of throwing his shoes over the fence. I remember his shoes had little holes in the bottom where pebbles might get stuck. I carried them back to the fence and tossed them over to the kid. He looked up at me and sniffled before running back to the cafeteria. I saw Denny at the top of the Big Kids Slide. I smiled and waved and his expression turned to terror at being associated with Weird Old Guy Who Helped Nerd With Shoes and he slid down toward the wood chips.

Lately I've been holed up waiting for my knees to heal. I can't really blame myself for not doing my Seated Leg Extensions since I've been skipping my PT sessions with a beefy guy I like to call the General. Sasha made me switch to a male physical therapist which is understandable given my track record. So these days I watch over the house and strengthen my mind. I've never been what you'd call a cerebral fellow, but it's hard not to feel like a smarty pants when you're firing off eight sales a minute on Arbitrage!.

I was explaining to Denny the cost-of-carry for human assets, what with vaccines, shipment, and offshore holding cells when Sasha pulled up in the family station wagon. She opened the door in a huff, stomping the snow off her shoes. Mommy! chirped Denny as he sprang off the couch for a hug. The TeleClick flashed and rumbled like a restaurant buzzer.  Denny ran back to the coffee table to make his Last Trade of the Day, leaving his mom with open arms and a slightly broken look. She ignored my hello and dropped some takeout on my lap. Dr. Horowitz recommended that we focus on Tension Easing Humor this quarter so I made a big show of rubbing my knee braces like it hurt.

I pulled out a carton of broccoli tofu and got to work splitting it into three portions. Sasha wouldn’t take a bite until I turned off the Arbitrage! live stream. I knew this was the only time we got together so I didn't make a big deal about how we were missing this week’s after hours trading special — estranged Pacific Islanders. I pulled out my planner and checked off “quality family time”. The three of us nodded for a quick prayer, styrofoam plates balancing on our laps. Denny used his disposable chopsticks to grab broccoli off my plate between bites.

“When did you learn to use chopsticks?” asked Sasha.

“Daddy taught me.”

“Your dad seems to know a lot doesn’t he?”

"He sure does. Today he taught me to capitalize on market inefficiencies. I made seventeen bucks on Arbitrage!"

"I don't know how you boys do it." Sash said in a sing song voice. She mimed a musical chimp, clapping her hands like cymbals.

Denny giggled and played along on an imaginary snare drum with his chopsticks. What a great kid. Some dads might call him a wuss but they'd be missing what a sweet boy he's turning out to be. Sometimes I worry that he has a hard time making friends in school. We've been planning a trip to the mountains so he can learn to snowboard. I think it'd be good for him to do some physical activities, give him something to relate to with the other little boys in class.

We finished up our supper and Denny asked if we could turn the live stream back on. The Living Asset Corralling Phase of Arbitrage! is strictly PG-13, off limits for Denny when Sasha's around. Instead I found some old sitcoms Sash and I used to watch when we first started dating. I enabled the LiveCaption youth plugin to reframe the jokes and innuendos as family-friendly learning opportunities. Sasha sat hunched over her phone, drafting invoices.

Dr. Horowitz wants Sash and I find more common ground to share with Denny. And I've been trying with Arbitrage!, but Sash just isn't interested in the living assets trade. One night when I couldn't sleep I went downstairs for a glass of milk and saw Sash lying on the couch pjs askew whispering into the TeleClick. It flashed and rumbled like a restaurant buzzer. That's when I realized Sash and I had an intimacy problem.

Sasha’s what you can call upset. Ever since the accident, I’ve been cooped up at home having lots of quality time with Denny and I get it, she hardly gets to see our little guy. She leads a sales team at Carbónairé, convincing office managers to buy cases of sparkling water for their employees. And boy is she good at it. She could sell you the shoes right off your feet. She's been selling things since she could talk, maybe earlier. When she was a kid she'd cut up her clothes and pawn them off to other kids as high fashion. It's too bad all this selling doesn't make her happy, she's always getting tied up in the morality of consumption and all that. I say she's overthinking it. Sometimes I wonder how Sasha fell for a guy like me. Back then I was still a contractor's apprentice for Sasha’s uncle, Big Mike. He has hands like baseball mitts and a booming laugh that runs in the family. He ran the biggest construction business in town at the time and was friends with all the graying mob bosses. Sometimes he'd have us lay out the bodies in the concrete foundation of mansions during renovation jobs. I always loved waste disposal days. I would take my bonus and treat my friends to root beer floats at A&W. It's easy not to think when you're gulping down a root beer float with your buddies.

We had some good years, pouring our love into Denny, ignoring the flaws in each other and in our relationship. The accident really miffed things up. I was doing a recessed lighting job at the Cresci’s. The Cresci's were the kind of family with a rumpus room the size of our 2BR/1.5BA apartment. Needless to say they paid the big bucks. It was a pretty big job since I had to take out an old ceiling fan apparatus that hung over the spiral staircase. So I’d been stopping by for a couple weeks to get the prelim planning out of the way. Marie C got the door as usual since Mr. C and the kids were out at work and school. I sat on the couch and Marie got me some water, Sparky yapping at her calves. We had what you might call a history, me and Marie. We’d talked about setting boundaries and all that but when she jumped my bones there was no was I was gonna say no. Big Mike always said not to mix business and pleasure and just like me I got what was coming to me. By the time I got my glasses back on I was all hot with afterglow and slipped off the ladder. There I was hanging two floors up on the ceiling fan, Sparky barking up help the best he could. I felt like I could hold on forever but I heard a crack and down I came. Marie was in a fluster, coughing up drywall dust. At that point all I could think of were my shattered knees.

You can imagine I wasn't feeling so great the next day. I got Stacy Reynolds from the contractor's union on the phone and learned about Contractor Endangerment Reparations. Imagine Mr. C's face when he found out the union might sue. I was ready for a big payout, easy street for me, Sash, and Denny. What really happened was that Mr. C reviewed his CC surveillance tapes and sent Sasha a copy of me and Marie C consummating our affair on Mr. C's favorite recliner. It really hurt Sash. My dad always told me: deny deny deny, but what can you do when there's HD evidence of your infidelity? In the end Mr C paid us a good chunk of dough to sign the settlement form his lawyers drafted, but that's not much consolation for what I did to Sash.

Work's been pretty dry since Mr. C blacklisted me. So between pulling Denny out of space camp and Sash playing back the audio recording of me moaning Marie C’s name every time I try to snuggle up against her, you could say life’s been a little different.

When I told Denny about our trip to see Arbitrage! live in person he was beside himself, all wow wow daddy! on repeat. I even convinced Sash to fly out to the city with us.

We took a cab from LaGuardia, the three of us jammed into the back seat with Denny in the middle. We passed an old retrofit/disposal job I'd done with Big Mike back when Sash and I were still dating. Sash was interning in the city at the time. She lived at Big Mike's Jersey villa, being his favorite neice and all. I got an invite for Thanksgiving one year and wound up falling head over heals for Sash. Big Mike loved the holidays. He'd wear his Kiss The Chef apron and dance around with his favorite meat cleaver. He sliced the turkey down the middle in one chop. Sash and I held hands underneath the table. I'd spoon feed her cranberry sauce while Big Mike wasn't looking.

We crossed over the East River. "Look at that skyline", I said. "You know what those buildings are Denny?"
"Those are the towers of American finance," said Denny proudly.
Sash groaned at her phone. Since when was she was too busy to appreciate the blossoming of our son?

We arrived at the hotel and filled out our adhesive name tags. I was finally off my knee braces and I felt pretty good, if a little wobbly.

It was after hours, but I convinced Sash and Denny to accompany me to the Arbitrage! studio lobby. Its walls were lined with a history of the Living Assets Abstraction Bill. Sash wasn't impressed by the groundbreaking law. She failed to see the value of opening the markets for the labor trade, how it made ventures like Arbitrage! possible. She squinted at the holding cell specifications. Typical Sash, overthinking the little things.

Denny wandered off and oggled at the Kids Fun Zone. The enclosed jungle gym was styled as a safe-for-kids version of a standard asset holding cell, complete with rope swing and climbing cage. On the wall was a plaque with host Ricky Lane's portrait, along with the Arbitrage! Affirmations: YOU make the calls, YOU make the markets, YOU make your destiny.

We returned to the hotel, buffet vouchers in hand. We were careful only to pick items listed as all-inclusive. I looked at the other dads with their slick button-downs and shiny watches and wondered which ones were there for free like us. On the way back from my second plate I saw a family of four nodding their heads in prayer, minus the baby, who was wriggling in its high chair trying to grab its sister's ear. The baby wore an Arbitrage! branded bib. Their plates were stacked high with food like they were afraid there wouldn't be any left for a second round. Clearly they hadn't been to many all-you-care-to-eat buffets. They finished saying grace and looked up at me.

I smiled a big smile. “You must be here for Arbitrage! live.”

The mom gave me a super interested grin and started rattling off the diversity of the underlying assets in her portfolio. She held futures on a couple from Mali who had pledged a decade each to send their daughter to secondary school. She was long on Tunisian farmers, short on Somalian woodworkers. Her name was Pooja and her name tag was highlighted with flowers and smiley faces. I asked why her husband didn’t share in her enthusiasm.

“Oh Sumeet’s been all uptight since his brother-in-law pledged. The family lives near the Connecticut facility so the handlers arrived the same day. They prepped and vaccinated him right there in the driveway of their duplex. They squared away the family cash-wise, and got out of there before dinner. We didn’t even hear about it till he was en route to a holding cell. I say good riddance, he had a drinking problem and that money is doing poor Riya and the kids a lot more good than he ever did. But Sumeet and him got along well, so you can see how he'd be upset.”

I’d never heard of nationals being traded on Arbitrage!. Pooja explained that investing in domestic assets required a Patriots In Our Backyard expansion, and that there were some tricky tax stipulations to work through before investing. Pooja lowered her voice, saying that American labor was severely overvalued. I just nodded and smiled. A hotel full of people as excited about Arbitrage! as me! I was so happy I let Denny have an extra dish of ice cream.

Next day we were waiting in the studio lobby, trying to get a glimpse of Ricky Lane before the show. Pooja came up with a big smile. She introduced Sumeet and her kids to Sash and Denny. Their daughter was about Denny's age, maybe older. She led Denny by the hand toward the Kids Fun Zone. I made a fuss about letting Denny go on by himself but Sash and Pooja gave me a look saying come on let the kid breathe a little.

Pooja kept saying, beautiful children, beautiful children, and who can blame her?

A buzzer went off. We filed onto the bleachers with the rest of the studio audience.

The lights went down and host Ricky Lane emerged from an array of flashing lights and smoke machines. He paced back and forth waving his arms in the air asking who's ready for a better life, who's ready for Arbitrage!. The crowd went wild stomping on the bleachers and I heard myself shouting back we are we are we are. Two minutes till market open we pulled out our TeleClicks and loaded our portfolios. Ricky Lane gave the lightning summary of today's trends and his refugee pick of the day. He shouted the Affirmations and we responded. I was swooning. We began the countdown until market open.

I remembered Dr. Horowitz and his thing about finding common ground. Sash was finally giving Arbitrage! a chance. We were on our way to a better life together. I turned to her and showed her my first trade of the day. To my surprise she was holding her own TeleClick, firing off trades like a pro. I paused and looked at her positions. Her numbers looked good. Where did she get all that cash?

It didn't matter. We could finally start trading as a family. And there we were trading together in a state of bliss, neither of us saying a word to break the flow, all the way until the first commercial break. It was the most intimate we'd been in years.

I was the first to speak. "That was incredible, Sash."

Sash didn't answer. She was embarrassed, understandably. She'd been trading all along. And now she was caught off her moral high horse. I assured her that whatever reasons she had for hiding her trades from the family were OK. That I still loved and respected her. I told her that we could merge our accounts, that she could even keep some money in hers separate since I knew she valued independence and all that. But first thing was to merge them. It would be great to have this extra source of income. We might even be able to send Danny to sleep away camp in the summer. "I'm leaving you," she said. And there were the renovations we'd be able to afford, and finally make a down payment on a real house with a front yard and Sasha repeated herself "I'm leaving you". When its meaning finally registered I felt the cinder block against my head. I heard myself saying, but Denny!, and what were we going to do and Sash said Denny deserved to know the truth and I told her she was making a huge mistake and that this was a choice and she told me I'd already made mine.

Pooja' voice cut through frantic and she told us to come out to the kids area right away. We pushed our way down the bleachers as Ricky Lane concluded a brief message from his sponsors, cattle prod in hand for the Living Asset Corralling Phase.

My knees ached. Sash ran out and I followed the best I could. She got there first. Denny was crying with his leg twisted up in the climbing cage. He wouldn't let her touch him and kept calling out daddy daddy. I walked up to our little guy and he relaxed enough for me to get his leg out.

"Knee problems run in the family huh champ?" I said.

Denny sniffled and nodded.

"Don't you worry. We'll have you fixed up in no time." Denny's leg was a real mess. He tried to stand up and crumpled back down with a little yelp. I mumbled something about the cost of an ambulance. Sash called a cab. I eased Denny into the back seat and Sash left the guy a big fat tip for getting us there so fast.

The patients at the clinic were all coughs and moans. It seemed like everyone else there was hurting even worse than Denny. He whimpered quietly into Sasha's shoulder. What a brave kid. I patted Denny's shoulder and told him that it would be okay. Sash wouldn't make I contact with me. I gave her a reassuring pat on the knee and she tensed up with a shudder. I shrugged and wondered if there was an Arbitrage! connection nearby.

It was dark by the time the nurse called our name. After the doctor fixed him up I went around the corner to get us some pizza. By the time I got back Denny was asleep on the hospital bed, Sash dozing off next to him. I left their slices on the bedside table and sat down across the bed from Sash. I looked at Denny's full leg cast and wondered how much the insurance would cover. I pictured Denny going back to school all proud with a new pack of Sharpies for the kids to sign.

The next morning I woke up face down in the hospital sheets. Denny was still asleep. Sash looked across the bed at me. The sheet creases had made red lines across her face. She laughed and said I had the same lines. For a moment I thought I might be off the hook. Then Big Mike came in wearing his Kiss The Chef apron. He put his big hands on my shoulders and escorted me to an empty room next door. He suggested that I keep my mouth shut so I wouldn't wake Denny. All I could think was what the heck Sash, I thought we were on the same team here?

These days Sasha calls the shots. She pooled some of her Arbitrage! earnings with a loan from Big Mike to buy a small house in the same fancy school district as the Cresci's. So no more field trips to the rail yard for Denny. Sash agreed to let me stay with her until I figure out my situation, provided I behave myself. She doesn't have to worry about me though, on account of Big Mike taking care of my libido problem. I've got this nice set up in the den with an Arbitrage! direct connection so that me and Denny can trade when he's not hanging out with his new friends. Sash even promised me some spending money, which I'll pool with Denny's allowance for trades. I sleep on the pull out sofa unless Sash is having guests over, then I usually take the floor in Denny's room. It goes without saying that my sex life is practically non-existent. Sometimes Sash lets me watch while she makes love to our new neighbors, but that kind of thing gets old pretty quick.

It would be a long shot to say we're the family I always imagined having, but it's good that we're together under the same roof. Sash likes to joke about pledging me to the nationals market. She'll say that I'd never make it in a holding cell and can hardly control her giggles. Sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly adventurous, I'll go through the stack of Taking the Patriot's Pledge actuarial questionnaires Sash leaves by my door and calculate the present value of my life.
