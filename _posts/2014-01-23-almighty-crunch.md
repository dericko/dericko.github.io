> "Consider (do) memory experiments (sensory) in relation to writing, for example, record all sense images that remain from breakfast..." [-Bernadette Mayer][bernadette-mayer]

__All that’s left is the crunch.__ White porcelain disc, white porcelain bowl. Bells ring for fallen silverware. White fluid spills on over off brand bunches of oats. If you can smell milk you don’t want it. But notice the aroma: woody tones over something sweet, something burning, something charred. Anticipation tells of bagels. The smell of urine is urine. A morning without room for idleness. Spring pop, excited. Hot in hand, but too quick to burn. Dexterity and momentum, drawer to door to spin round the countertop.

Deposit cream cheese. Left hand burns, right hand spreads:

knife   
across the surface doubles back   
across the surface wrist rotation   
edge to edge an even form then   
stop  
buildup coalesce  
layer up to finish.

All is in the crunch. Inner ear throbs chew for chew, outer ear endures unpleasant pings of metal upon plate upon table upon floor.
