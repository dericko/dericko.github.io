So me and Marco went up to our uncle’s place last weekend. They said we’d have the place to ourselves, to drink, chill, or whatever. We were just happy for the chance to get out of the house.

They had separate garages, one for cars, and the other for tools and wood and stuff. I guess the other one was more like a workshop. The one for cars had this brand new red Mustang, really spotless. I don’t know much about cars, but I know nice when I see it. Marco heard they had it special ordered since the dealer only had the V6 and they wanted a little extra kick in their ride.

For a while, we were on the couch watching some HBO show that I wasn’t into. But Marco had bought some beers and thought it’d be fun to drink every time the main guy made a joke about minorities or got to second base (or third) with some girl who wasn’t his wife. I had four beers and Marco had like eight.

“I guess you win,” I said.

He just laughed and said, “let’s go for a ride.”

I thought yeah, it sounds fun but he shouldn’t drive because he could get caught up with a DUI. Marco called me a pussy and tossed me the keys to the Mustang.

I hesitated because I remembered hearing about an underage kid at school losing his license when he got pulled over after just one drink. But I wasn’t some dumb high school kid anymore, and I didn’t have a license anyway. Besides, Marco said it was cool if I just drove until he was sober enough, so I said okay.
Marco got the rest of the beers and I followed him past the tool garage to the car garage. He stood in the doorway to drink another beer, but I went straight to the driver’s door and got in.
The smell of the plastic leather steering wheel reminded me of when dad came home with a new Honda Civic for mom. It wasn’t actually new, but the dealer guys must have sprayed something to make it smell new. Mom flipped. She was super happy. Probably the happiest time we had as a family. I was still staring at the wheel when Marco got in beside me with the last couple beers, laughing because I was making a dumb face.
We were extra careful with the garage door and I double-checked at every stop sign before going. But it was late so the streets were pretty empty anyway. I turned on the radio and Marco changed the station to 106.1, blasting hip-hop from the speakers.

Marco was looking at his phone and shouted to “turn right here!” so that we could head toward this always-open taco spot he had heard about. He yelled out the directions as he read them from the phone.
We were at the corner of some small street when we saw this group of like six kids crossing in front of us. There were four guys and two girls, probably high schoolers. The guys were wearing the same thing: gym shorts and band Ts with writing I couldn’t read. The first girl was pretty. She had brown hair that went all over the place. My headlights reflected on an earring poking out of her hair where the top of her ear would be. I thought she turned and sort of smiled at me, but probably not since the headlights would have been all bright in her face if she did. But one of the guys in front of her noticed whatever I noticed and said something and pointed at us.
Of course Marco rolled down the window and shouted some offensive shit at them, so I rolled mine down too and shouted, “Get off the road!” Then I slammed on the gas and we laughed. Even with the radio blaring, all we could hear was that V8 engine roar.

I think I missed the turn but I don’t really remember. Marco said I did, but he also gave shitty directions. We’d always be halfway through the intersection when he’d scream: “turn left!” But he did good for a drunk person I guess.

We ran out of beers and still couldn’t find the taco place, so we finally turned onto McAllister Ave., a main-looking street, where there might be a spot for food. I saw the neon sign for Sonic and hit Marco in the chest since he was dozing off a little. He snapped up and we got ready to feast.
We had two of those all-you-can-mix drinks with like eight flavors each in the cup holders. I had something like the whole value menu on my lap, and a milkshake between my knees. Marco was already stuffing his face when we left the pickup window. I pulled into the lot next to Sonic.

I was about to eat my second burger when I saw this homeless guy all hunched over a shopping cart, pushing it down the sidewalk on the other side of McAllister Ave. I almost felt bad about eating all that awesome food when that guy probably didn’t even have dinner. But he probably did drugs or something, so maybe he wasn’t hungry. I wanted to teleport one of my burgers or hot dogs or fries to a bench ahead of the guy so he could find it.
“Go ahead, teleport away,” said Marco, “Just don’t get close to him. He might have lice or AIDs or something.” We laughed, and the guy kept on his way.

We definitely bought too much food. We opened our doors and swept the wrappers onto the ground, then balanced the rest of the burgers on the dash. I turned the radio back on. Some DJ was talking about a sick track that he had featured on the night owl mix. I backed up a little too confidently and had to slam on the breaks to avoid a dumpster. Marco caught the burgers before they landed on us.

We were about to turn out of the lot, but when I looked left I saw people walking. It was those kids again. Marco made me roll down my window and shouted pinche-something. They mostly ignored us but a couple of the guys put their arms up to say: “what do you want?” I revved the engine again and made a left onto McAllister. They were at the corner when I passed, so I flipped them off. Marco couldn’t stop laughing.

It was pretty funny. We cruised for another block down McAllister, windows down, and really blasted the music. At the light, I leaned my head against the headrest. The bass was great, like a chest massage from the inside. I stared up at the vibrating rearview mirror.

I rubbed my hand across the steering wheel. Who cares what Dad thinks. If I had a job I wouldn’t still be living at home in the first place. We’d figure things out, me and Marco, and we’d take on the world. Soon we’d have our own Mustangs and fancy garages. Out the window, I saw that homeless guy at the opposite corner, struggling to get his cart up the curb.

I looked back at the mirror. Two of the guys were walking ahead of the group of kids, looking back to the others and then at us. They stepped into the street and started toward the car. I saw them shouting, but didn’t hear it over the music. Marco hadn’t noticed. I looked up at the red light and felt sweat between my fingers as I gripped the brand new plastic of the steering wheel.

And then Marco was yelling, ”Dude, shit, go! go!” I grabbed the only thing within reach and threw it out the window. “The fuck are you doing?” Eight flavors of blue-green soda water flew in the air as my soda cup landed on the pavement. “He’s got something in his hand—GO!” My foot finally responded and I floored the gas pedal. I heard yelling outside the window and inside the car. My eyes stayed on the rearview mirror.

My head snapped down as the car jumped a curb. I saw someone in front of the car and then to the side. I slammed on the breaks as a shopping cart bounced off the hood, scattering its contents in all directions.

I looked up. The radio was silent. Marco was swearing: there was fucking milkshake all over the fucking interior. I looked at my hands. There was a cut on my right knuckle. I sat up fast and looked around, but the two guys were gone.

I opened the door and stepped out. A bent up shopping cart lay on its side a few yards in front of the car. I felt something crack underneath me. It looked like porcelain, a teapot or something. There were pieces all over the sidewalk. I turned to see a man in dirty clothing on his knees, sweeping the pieces into piles with his hands.

“Are you alright man?” I asked. He didn’t respond, just kept sweeping. “You didn’t get hurt or anything?” I took a step closer and he stopped.

He sat up, cross-legged, sorting through one of the piles. “Gone gone, all along,” he said in something between a song and a mutter.

“Jeez what happened? Did you see anything? There were these thugs coming after us.”
He held up two pieces, trying to fit them together. I ran back to the car and dug up one of the Sonic bags.

“Do you want a burger?”

I handed him a chicken sandwich. He grabbed it and started eating.

Marco was in the driver’s seat and yelled something at me. I got up, stumbled over to the passengers seat, sat down, and closed my eyes as we backed off the curb and sped down the street.
