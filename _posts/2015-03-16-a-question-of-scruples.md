Alex stood at the library kiosk and checked the inbox of his FindMeAWinner™ account. Three new matches. He opened each and scribbled the About Me descriptions into his notebook.

So you’re strapped to a giant parachute sitting in the back of a speedboat, waiting for the wind to carry you up into the sky or crashing down into the waves, but that doesn’t really happen does it? Well, I’d already convinced my buddies to come out on this trip and I wasn’t about to back out of it. Hey there, I’m Rob. City dweller and weekend explorer. Send me a message, let’s get to know each other.

“Nice, I could use that,” Alex said to himself.

He clicked on his profile page and admired his creation. A simple research profile, just for collecting harmless data, nothing more. Rather than his own photo and description, it featured a woman who did not exist. An attractive woman: right hair, right height, a cocktail of pep and spontaneity formulated to entice the best men. Men just like Alex, but better with words. Men just like what he would be, once he’d finished collecting their slick intros and anecdotes. He filed each story in his notebook, recounting them as his own on other dating sites, on which he’d had quite a bit of success.

“Hey buddy, there’s a five minute limit on these things. You gonna look up a title or what?”

Alex snatched up the notebook and clutched it to his chest. The next patron approached the book-lookup station and Alex flipped him off, arm fully extended. He smirked at the others in line and returned to the wellness studio.

His brother sat on the counter. “Long lunch, eh Alex?”

Alex looked down at his notebook. “Yeah I got a call from Aunt Josephine—just couldn’t get off the phone. She kept talking and talking, about stuff and, you know how she is.”

“Really? I haven’t heard from her in years,” said Danny, walking into the session room, “Must have been something important. What’d she say?”

“Yeah, sure. Nothing much.”

Danny returned with a small stereo. “Were you playing music during the morning meditative session?”

“Yeah, needed something upbeat, you know? Can’t just be om’s, ah’s, and silence, were gonna make them crazy. Half the chicks out here already think they’re crazy. And that’s where we come in, we’re healers lil brother, that’s what we are.  I’m going out for a smoke, maybe a drink. Can you get ready to check people in? It’s the weekend, there’s always a rush after lunch.”

“Yeah yeah, will do.”

“Nice. And make sure you lock up tonight, I’ve got a date.” He added with a wink, “and I might not be back before closing.”

Danny approached the front desk. He couldn’t remember the password for the check-in system. The door gave a jingle, and he looked up with a smile.

“Hi, you’re Alex right?”

“That’s my brother. I’m Danny, nice to meet you.”

“Oh, where is he? My friends just loved his session last week. Loved it enough to convince me to come! Group mediation breathing therapy, now that’s a mouthful. Never thought I’d be at one of these places, but here I am!”

A second young woman entered the wellness studio. “Is Alex here?”

“He’s out for the day. I’ll be leading the afternoon session.”

“Oh, you’re the brother aren’t you? So you must be all zen too then.”

“Sure, you could say that.” Danny felt a breeze as the door opened for a third time.

“Sophie you made it!” The first woman turned toward the door.

“Hey Danny, you’re teaching today right? Cool. Too bad Alex is out huh?”

Sophie led the other women to the waiting area.

If he couldn’t remember the password then they couldn’t charge for the session. Danny thumbed his notebook. He shuffled through the drawers but found no hints or alternate logins. There wasn’t even any scratch paper. He looked back at his notebook, opened it up, and tore out a page.

“Excuse me, ladies? May I have your names?” He added, “It’s just to check you in, that’s all.”

“Jane Gray. That’s Donna and that’s Sophie. But I think you already knew Sophie right? She said she had you for classes before so I would hope you would remember her. Okay, so question. Who started first, you or Alex?”

Danny wrote out their names. “Me. I started yoga back in high school. It was always something I enjoyed, I guess.”

“So you got your brother into it?” asked Sophie.

“Sort of. When I told Alex I was getting certified he got really excited about the whole thing. Starting getting certified for all kinds of things. But really, he’s the man.”

“But Alex is just so zen, I can’t believe he hasn’t been doing this his whole life.  I mean just thinking about him makes me feel so peaceful. How do I get better at this? I’ve been working on my breathing lately and I just can’t focus. I’m sitting there breathing in, and then suddenly I’m like my shoes are green I’m hungry, you know?”

“It’s not so much about getting good at it, but building your awareness about yourself. If you just do it ‘cause it feels nice and do it enough, you get better.”

“But I mean, Alex told me about this thing about mental blocks and you know. Like if I could really focus I could channel my energy into, well into my practice and in my life or whatever.”

“I’m so jealous, you’ve had wellness for so long. Meditating and shit must come so natural to you,” added Donna.

“Yeah, it’s really the only thing I’ve ever done.” Danny ran his fingers along the torn edge of his notebook and stared at the miniature bonsai on the counter. He stood up. “Well, shall we?”

**

“That’ll be fifteen bucks.”

“Hey man,” said Alex to the cab driver, “I’ve only got ten cash on me. I’ll just pay card though if that’s cool.”

“Are you kidding me? Look just give me ten and get out.”

Alex ran into the liquor store next door and bought a fifth of scotch with cash. He arrived at the diner breathless. It was quarter-past seven, fashionably late. He approached his date, wearing a red scarf in her hair like they agreed on.

“Hey Kate—Katie, what’s up? Wow, you look even hotter than you did on your profile pics.”

“It’s Kate. Thanks.”

“Hold on, I’ll be right back.”

Alex returned to the diner booth with two cups of ice. He poured the scotch, first for his date, then for himself. He reached his hand out for an unrequited fist bump.

“So,” Kate started, “what is it you do again?”

“I’m a wellness trainer. You know, relaxation, meditation, breath work. We offer a little of everything. You should try it sometime.”

“Oh, that’s cool. Are you some kind of doctor or something?”

“Sure, you could say that. It started out as my own thing, then my little brother got into it, so I worked with him, pretty much taught him everything he knows. So then we opened up a little studio to help other people. For what we charge them we might as well be doctors!” Alex laughed.

“I guess so.”

“Well,” began Alex, “the great part about it is that it gives me the time to do what I really want to do. So last weekend, I convinced some buddies of mine to go parasailing. I mean imagine: you’re strapped to a giant parachute sitting in the back of a speedboat, waiting for the wind to carry you up into the sky or crashing down into the waves, and—”    

“Excuse me sir, we don’t allow customers to pour their own drinks.”
Alex shoved the bottle under his chair without looking up.

“Just so you know for next time.” She smiled and walked away.

“Haha fuck her, right?” said Alex.

Katie swirled the ice cubes in her glass.

“Gotta hate waitresses. You think I played dumb enough?”
She shrugged and took a long drink.

“It’s easy ‘cause I’m dumb.”
