wire

frame  
into the hanger hook slingshot witheld  
when never for perch twigfeet  
curling knarling claws ravaneous  
geneous phrenology syllogism  
potential wanton warring as state  
estate stone field wander spikes  
barb elbows underneath skylight  
pale as  
underneath the forestry  
wrap wrap once again  
sonic coils no foil in the  
micrometer measure of pain  
sharp as  
boiled noodle soup of tacks  
wire tap wire wrap  
wire flap wire sneeze  
telephonic telekenesis  
whale whale on the wall  
wire wiring through the  
into out of  
coming in without hasten  
order balance  
fifteen cents  
wire tap Western Union  
bits & pieces
