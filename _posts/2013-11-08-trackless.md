__Wake without rising.__ Bask in the indulgent silence of a morning unscheduled. Lay through the final hour of the forenoon. After an extended and uninteresting cellular perusal, a thumb finds an icon, and stumbles upon a fact: one hundred percent chance of snow. At this the shoulders are driven forward, forcing the confrontation of body to world. Breathing window fog, nose presses against the glass, and all is white.

__Settled precarious__ atop the thinnest lamppost and slanted awning, it puts gravity to shame in the windless chill: falling, adding, compounding. A young snow holds no traces. The white mass lays prone, budding with the novelty of unfulfilled potential.
The clouds above look down upon the streets and cover every inch of every of every surface with utter whiteness until the concealment of human markings is complete. But the clouds above pour down upon the streets in but two dimensions, unable to coat the vertical. Changing maps, zooming into street view, the trackless drift yields to the addition of dimension. Observe the markers of a world with depth: these frosted hats are the sky's view of fire hydrants, the bleached woolen mounds are its take on postboxes, and each glazed-donut ring is the aerial conception of a rubbish bin.

The intersection is a soggy bog of tainted slush. The imagined fumes of rot accompany the stains of roadside piles. For fear of utter disenchantment, do not explore it further.

__March along, mark along__ tracing a path for the bulging clouds to fill. To the left are steady and heavy-footed presses, indicative of an athletic type, each stamp compressing ice crystals downward toward the unseen sidewalk. To the right, an uncertain shuffle, attempting the lines of cross-country skis. In between is a shallow channel, snaking left and right from path to path. Only the keenest of trackers would read the playful sway yet perfect uniformity of this trough as indicative of sidewalk soccer. At the corner, a muddled queue of prints: an excess of weight on the outer left foot, followed by a break in the trail, the deep indents of a jump, a landing, and the shuffle of balance restored.

Destination at last: before entering, find the first trace of human presence in the form of a perfect vertical silhouette: a parting of the white mound, sliced with utter precision, reveals a keycard's path before it begins. An outline of the daily procession of approaching and swiping and entering. Today the cyclic routine, the repeated actions accumulated as a life, can be traced, noted, and savored.
