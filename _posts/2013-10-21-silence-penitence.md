__An Experiment__

Eyes contact, hands gesture, and fingers point. The occasional "sorry, excuse me" to strangers. Was that muffled laughter? An experience shared? Their solemn pact is undermined over and over again. Each misstep is a reminder that the silence hanging in the air is patently artificial, barely held together by the strained, uncomfortable efforts of each. They're trying their best, but misanthropy isn’t as easy as it sounds.

They hail a cab, hoping to avoid the approaching rainstorm. As it pulls up to the curb, they make their pact of silence. The silence starts...now.

The driver asks where they are headed. Laughing awkwardly, they respond. So, the silence starts...now.

The cab whooshes past Market Street. The television on the back seat lights up, flashing clips of entertainment news from this past week. They glance at each other; the strangeness of the situation elicits a shared giggle. And they'd been doing so well, too. Alas, the silence starts...now.

They arrive at the Eastern State Penitentiary. They look at each other, nervous. To save themselves from inadvertently breaking their vows, he passes up cash. It was a close call.

The Penitentiary looms expectantly overhead. Wordlessly prompted, they shuffle forward.

Inside, they are three prisoners with two options: move individually, or move as a unit. By separating, they defeat the purpose of the experiment--they isolate themselves for a short amount of time and explore the area, which is hardly out of the ordinary in a museum. By sticking together, they destroy the experiment--each bases his or her actions on the observed actions of the others, forcing an array of facial expressions, hand gestures, and other non-verbal cues. In the gloom of the penitentiary, they quickly choose the latter. What happens at the end of the hallway? Eyes meet and fly downwards. A suppression of the urge to gesture with one’s hands. One left, one right, one plays tiebreaker, and in the end they follow each other. 

They are collective mind. One points at a board describing women in prison. The others attempt to decipher. What has caught her interest? A picture? A caption? A story? Their eyes meet, and lower to the floor. Without looking up, each imagines what the pointer is focussed on. They nod in understanding. By limiting speech, every other social cue is amplified. Even without speech, the natural impulse to communication re-emerges and finds new channels to display itself. They walk out of an archway to find heavy rain, and automatically turn back around. Gestures are no longer necessary. The social cues and nudges of speech--”how are you?”, “let’s go back,” ”look at this!”--melt away to a common, comfortable understanding. As one drifts toward an empty cell, the others follow naturally.

When they find themselves by the exit once more, the vow of silence has officially ended. Yet speech is uncomfortable. On the ride home, they slowly erode their mutual understandings with trivial facts gleaned in politeness and forced conversation. As they approach campus, they collectively lose interest in one another and stare out the windows, relieved.
