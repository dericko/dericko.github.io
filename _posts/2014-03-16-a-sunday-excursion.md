__Attempt at ascension__
And with a start I woke up quick—to the right a blaring throbbing in my head, and a hand burst forth into the cool quick air to stop the unholy, undying, unbearable blare. Trapped in the concave cocoon of mattress sheet and bed I need to find a way to fix this dumb numb brain of mine.

__Like clockwork__
A quick flip the switch is on the plug is in and then—just then I turn the tap and out the fluid flows flooding heat plate with cool wetness ready to be transformed, as I grind the shiny gems into the black crack I crave. Click! And pour the heat into the mound below. It settles and condenses—each spot of powder darkens one by one and two by two and more by more and all over in and out until the wetness reaches edge and all I see is   _Coffee._
And without hesitation I engulf my senses flood my numbness out each side and fill myself with caffeination.

__An approach__
I see the red stop sign looking up at me. Who do you think you are? Just a sign, not even—A mere flap attached to metal walls painted yellow over black rubber wheels. Just a message temporary, at the mercy of the driver, “HALT”. So you wield a special power? You're just a tool how dare you look up at me with your S-T-O-P.

To my right he sits, an unknown, invading privacy on my private ride, maliciously obligating me to be friendly on this early Sunday morning—who does that? I'll feign my importance by concentrating hard, flicking through my toughest problem set and furrowing brows over eyes traveling left, right, up, down, around, and not reading even one bit—quick glances right to see if he notices my lack of notice. I'll keep it up and brainstorm how to show my friendliness. But hold off on the spigot—I don't want to talk all day, keep an even pressure to establish friendly relations and then retreat back back back into an...

__Abyss of quiet comfort.__
And now I'm here. And all I see is the scrolling gray and green of street and trees slowing down as I look up from the road to the horizon. And in my head I feel the lack of numb sleepiness that my uncaffienated brethren are succumbing to and my state of greater awareness brings me to realize the horrific loneliness of boredom, the lack of attention and validation that I really don't care about—it's missing and I need it. Create fun by annoying those around me, I'll poke at sleeping Kevin, point right—it wasn't me! "Wake up you're being boring"—that'll get him up, can't fail to look cool in front of strangers. Let's talk jargon, personal items, those that no one else will get, we'll have jokes for us, exclusive—come on wake up just wake up I'm bored out of my mind. I'm sitting here, please. I'm sitting here, alone.
