title: Diary Of A Madman
description: "A spoken translation of Lu Xun’s Diary Of A Madman that maintains the sound and order of the original text, with sounds transcribed into a language poem. Part of an ongoing project."
categories: writing poetry

> After the initial block translation of [Diary Of A Madman][madman-english], I went through once, improving coherence with homophones and by adding punctuation and line endings. Each individual "poem" (stumbled upon through editing) is divided by bold text. Poem titles come from the text itself the same way that the verse does.  

> For anyone interested in the original 中文 text: [《狂人日记》][madman-chinese]
