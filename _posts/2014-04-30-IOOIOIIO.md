_____

###### I
Twin rails print parallel  
as shown upon snow.


##### O
Primordial leap: bipedal.  
Bones shaking, velocipede tracks  
feeble as a pennyfarthing.  
Wright brothers in waiting,  
the Hour has come.

_____

##### O
Preserving one's backside,  
a peasant petaso.  
The Wiltshire cure  
to any vegan.

###### I
shirtless  
thoughtless  

without cover  
without caution

Unfortunate sizzle  
and pop,  
scalding the skin above

_____

##### O
Always skyward gaze,  
lets go fly a kite (Sino).  
Montgolfiere full of hot air  
Lilienthalian Icarus  
New world Kitty   
Hawk Spruce Goose  
missions aborted  
passenger payload  
air traffic control  
(glorified crossing guard)  
aircraft missile?  
missed connection

###### I
A thirty thousand foot  
chance of the eye  
saw a city  
for the first time

_____

###### I
The vent  
no longer  
flows

The gaps  
obstructed 
dark

Discovered faith that night  
underneath   
a blanket

##### O
Centaur chimera siren, composite  
portent: of things to come 
Seer contra scientist  
how sinister? Succubus?  
Old time dichotomous:  
miss Shelley, old Ambras  
Enter Fuseli's canvas  
enuresis would be better.
