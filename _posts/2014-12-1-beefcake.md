It's 13:00 at the base of the north wall of the Fisk Tower, as Dayna Bishop stretches on the bustling lunchtime sidewalk. Her orange polyester leggings follow the curve of her thighs as Dayna whispers through the motions, “Arms down, touch the toes, nose to knees, knees to nose.” Pedestrians flow in either direction, carelessly disrupting her concentration. Dayna will climb unannounced. She closes her eyes and pictures the crowd before it appears, that crowd formed of nothing but curiosity and confusion, with necks turned upward toward the neon figure above, each member waiting in his twisted little heart for a slip, a single misstep, for the image of a falling Dayna Bishop tumbling back to earth. She opens her eyes, stands tall, and kicks off her heels. Dayna jumps to reach an overhanging sign and swings into position, eye-to-eye with the second story windowsill. Balancing on the edge, she rubs her hands in chalk dust and continues up the wall.

Clarence Lawrence sits at the rooftop with a dull gaze, surveying the city below. At these heights, the insignificance of them all is clear. A powerful man at the height of his career, Clarence leans back, resting his large forearms on his lap. His fingers twitch in anticipation as he examines his lunch spread, prepared by his companion Jean-Luc. Clarence raises a silver-rimmed glass and smiles at his reflection, brushing his hair back with his free hand. What a life, he thinks, as his finishes his wine. Jean-Luc stands at attention, pouring into his glass until it overflows.
“Tell me Jean-Luc, what can we do but feast, here at the top of the world?”
“Whatever you wish Mr. Lawrence.”
“Bring me another roast, Jean-Luc.”

Dayna ascends with flair. The first couple stories are a show of legs and cartwheels. She retraces the steps of her trial run, done in secret under cover of night, careful to appear carefree. A dozen bystanders have stopped to watch her feign imbalance at the forth story balcony. They watch her don a blindfold, reach upwards and backwards, and pull herself heels-over-head to the next floor. She removes the blindfold and bows, to the delight of them all.

As he feasts, Clarence recounts the morning of his first job. He remembers the thick orange carpet of his old apartment. That morning he stood at the bathroom sink, studying his face in the mirror. The running water smelled of sulfur and colored the sink basin yellow. He was clean-shaven with a strong jawline, a remarkably handsome young man. The younger Clarence removed a black ski mask from his rear pocket, and pulled it over his well-groomed face, obscuring all but the eyes. He pointed at his reflected image, clicking his teeth through the dark fabric.

The cement face of the Fisk Tower yields consistent handholds and footholds. Dayna Bishop increases her pace, forgetting herself, the wall, and the crowd one hundred feet down. She thinks back to this morning, about the stack of sponsorship letters on her counter. Ozone™, TrailteX™, ArcStone™, all lining up to pay her to do what she loves. Of course, there'd be permitting issues, terms and agreements, and no more of these one-off stunts. But no more officers up top to slap your wrists and charge you fines for having some fun, forcing her to work an extra shift at Marty's Tavern, to flex that tip-earning smile of hers for another pointless evening. It'd be certified, city-approved, clean-cut.

Clarence chews his roast in the presence of God. Jean-Luc busies himself about the rooftop, glancing nervously at the single steel access-door. He pays no mind to the man sitting cross-legged eating his lunchmeat with a face of pure bliss. Jean-Luc notices a growing crowd at the base of the tower, twenty stories down. He backs away from the edge and urges Clarence to do the same.
“A toast, Jean-Luc, to our blessed ascent” says Clarence, walking toward the edge with drink in hand, “To the fruits of our labor.” Clarence stands at the edge, waving his glass about for balance.

The crowd spills into the street, occupying the parallel parking spaces adjacent to Dayna Bishop's Vespa GTS. She approaches the tenth floor balcony, the last chance for anyone to stop her before she reaches the top. The onlookers below watch her legs disappear over the balcony's edge, holding their breath in wait for her to reappear at the next floor. There is no film crew among them, each member a part of a silent agreement to keep things hidden from the news and media in order to maintain the sanctity of the moment. When Dayna reaches the eleventh floor, she anchors herself with one hand and leans forward, raising an arm in appreciation to her followers, prompting cheers and applause from below.

Clarence pushes Jean-Luc back as he regains his balance at the edge. He is pleased to see the masses gathering in his honor. He toasts them with such fervor that he loses grip of his glass, which tumbles downward through the air, shattering below.

Dayna hardly notices the noises of the crowd. Tuning out the noise is a critical requirement for the Zen of performance climbing. She shifts her weight and grabs the next outcropped cement slab of the cleverly disguised drainpipe that she has chosen as her pathway. Dayna whistles to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March. Half a dozen floors and she'll be on top of the world.

Nobody is seriously injured, but there is fear in the crowd. A man instructs the others to keep calm, as he cradles his partner in his arms. He looks up the wall at the climber and back down at the broken glass and trace blood on his fingers. It has gone far enough. The man motions to the others to contact the authorities.

Clarence shifts his weight on and off his heels, feeling the breeze against his bare chest. He grins at the thought of himself, exposed in broad daylight before all. A motion in his periphery catches his attention.

Dayna reaches the roof's ledge and pulls herself up slowly, anticipating the usual rough handed officer to pull her the rest of the way, making comments about how such a sweet little thing like her shouldn't be up so high all alone. But there are no rough hands today. As she reaches the top, she rolls onto her back and looks at the sky with a smile.
She hears a voice, “Jean-Luc, we have a visitor! How nice of you to join us, love.”

Dayna jolts up and turns toward the voice. She lets out a snort. A shirtless man with flowing hair, in green tights not unlike her own, stands on the ledge some twenty feet away from her. He is tall and muscular, although his grey highlights and sagging belly tell of better days. Next to him, a skinny man in dressed in black holds a set of ropes, harnesses, and carabineers.

The Fisk Tower has steel reinforced roof-access door with a north-facing opening. In three minutes, the underpaid Fisk Civil Disturbance Team will stumble through. A loudspeaker affixed to the wall above the door informs Dayna of this.

“I am afraid we must be going. Come Jean-Luc,” says the bare-chested man.

Dayna reminds herself that she has no reason to worry. A climb always ends in an arrest. Yet something about the loudspeaker has made her uneasy. She looks down at the crowd. Men in uniforms have created a perimeter, closing all access to the north wall.

The bare-chested man approaches Dayna and stands on the ledge beside her and asks, “Why do you climb, child?”

Dayna shrugs, “I've always been a lousy bartender.”

As the door opens, Dayna Bishop and Clarence Lawrence stand together on the ledge, beneath the blue gaze of God.
