__Classroom Observations__

It is the soft elbow between afternoon and evening, that beautiful time for anything that is not related to work. Alas, together we sit in Fisher Bennett Room 139 and at precisely 2:51:33pm, we are ordered to observe.

In order of appearance: Professor, Alice, Virginia, Rebecca, Me, Nicole, Yong, Shams, Carl: Together we make 9. Also two windows: curtains closed. Intentions to block the sun have stifled any chance of creativity. 
 
Oh! there's a tension in the air, a softly budding silence and confusion that must delight Professor delightfully. As we shuffle our papers, one by one we glance up at our peers. Unable to act, we are all observing the act of observation, sadly defaulting to that of the eye. This mental photography is limiting, but the lack of anything remotely interesting forces us to use what we have. It is with shy eyes that we look up at each other, slowly realizing that there is absolutely nothing interesting to write about without stimuli, without conversation.

Matters are in no way improved by the invisible elephant, perched across in the void of four empty seats. The elephant is mute, yet its trumpet screams when our eyes meet those of the Professor, signaling her well-founded concern at our deficiency in literary sophistication. We have not been cultured sufficiently, yet given the weekly opportunity for self-improvement, of course we have not actually done the reading. But she takes it in good temper, letting us ponder our own failures without any observable condescension. Such is the kindness of an educator in power.  

Through experimentation, we had hoped to find something new, to pursue the lost pursuit of education without hidden intention, to find a lost ideal wrapped in ivy, of higher education unburdened by the noise of learning, that toilsome trinity of Reading, â€˜Riting, Repetition.

Can we catch the aura of a moment in a sketch? The skillful note taker notes the important things first: location, time, and things seen. There is exactness in this recollection. We observe specific detail of specific place, yet something is missing. In fact, everything is missing. Note taking tells what happened, that we can tell each other what happened; it shows us absolutely nothing new. 

Tedious note taking overwhelms it all with a list of disjoint specific details that rob experience of its realness. In order to capture something, jot down phrases that arise after the fact, single jewels that act as temporary place markers, rather than accurate descriptions. 

From here, perhaps we can find the single gem that can be entered, expanded, and reflected upon, hopefully with the tenacity of a benny addict. Snapshots and photos, figurative or otherwise, are too deliberate, too all-encompassing. Like digital film, they unabashedly capture and save everything, creating an impassible mass of noise, to be sorted out later.
